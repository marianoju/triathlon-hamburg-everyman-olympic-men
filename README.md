# Triathlon Hamburg Everyman Olympic Men 2009–2015

Data collected at [Triathlon Hamburg](http://hamburg-triathlon.org/) 2009–2015 (known 2009–2012 as Dextro Energy Triathlon ITU World Championship Hamburg and ITU World Triathlon Hamburg since 2013). 

The Triathlon Olympic Distance consists of 1.5 km swimming, 40 km biking and 10 km running. The ITU World Triathlon Hamburg claims to be known as the “The World's Biggest Tri” with more than 10,000 participants (actually the London Triathlon – currently known as the “AJ Bell London Triathlon”, and previously the “Virgin Active London Triathlon”, “Mazda London Triathlon” and the “Michelob ULTRA London Triathlon”, for sponsorship reasons – attracts more than 13,000 competitors, but is not an event of the International Triathlon Union). While elite athletes have to qualify for the race on Sunday so-called “everyman” competitors can sign up for the sprint distance (0,5km/22km/5km), the olympic distance (1,5km/40km/10km) or the relay together with friends (“Staffel”), family (“Staffel Familienwertung”) or colleagues (“Staffel Firmenwertung”) on Saturday (with the exception of 2013, when everyman competitors where split up into two races taking place on Saturday *and* Sunday). The number of places for solo competitors is strictly limited, and usually sold out well in advance. 

The swimming course is located in the Alster, a backed-up river with little current, creating a mild open water situation. The remaining course runs through the city center (Rathausmarkt) and along Reeperbahn, Elbchaussee and Alster's riverside, and has little difference in altitude (“mostly flat [bike] course” and “complete flat run course without any ascents”). Due to the large number of competitors the transition zone is exceptionally long with 800 m. For more information on the course see http://hamburg-triathlon.org/en/info/course/.

Timekeeping & Result Service is provided by mika:timing using reusable transponders and multiple measuring/check points.

## Participants not included in the sample: 
- DNS (Did Not Start) 
- DNF (Did Not Finish) 
- DQ (Disqualified) 
- participants missing split times

## Information removed from the sample: 
- club 
- (multiple) split check points 
- DQ 
- time penalties 

## Anomalies and measurement errors 
Transitions T1 and T2 show several cases of impossible and improbable times (e.g. 55 participants with T1 < 01:30, 78 participants with T1 < 03:00, 6 participants with T2 < 02:00). The transition zone is about 800 meters long. 

There is no way to determine if extreme outliers (i.e. times > 6 * standard deviation) are due to measurement errors or other factors e.g. late start, flat tire, collision with other participant(s). 

## Coding 
Inconsistencies in Age Class (also: Age Group) labels (e.g. AK4 or MAK4) have been standardized (to include the letter M for male participants).
